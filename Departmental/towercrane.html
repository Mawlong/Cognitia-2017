				<h1>Tower Crane</h1>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>Inspired by the actual design of tower crane and modelled on similar lines, this competition combines the intricacies of structural design<br>
				along with the complex science of construction.In this competition, the participants are required to build a tower crane which supports two counter<br>
				balancing loads at different ends of the cantilever in accordance with the design constraints.An optimised 3-dimensional truss has to be constructed<br>
				which can sustain extensive moments and loads, thus taking the concept of making planar structures to a higher level.</p>

				<h3>Rules</h3>
				<ol>
				<li><p>Participants have to prepare the models at home, so certificates will be awarded to all participants.</p></li>
				<li><p>Each team should consist of three or less than three members,preferably from the same institute.Each member is required to have a student ID<br>
				of their respective Institute</p></li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Specifications</h3>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
				<li><p>Make a tower crane,the structure must be made only from popsicle sticks and adhesive,which consist of a vertical mast and a lever-arm to support loads.</p></li>
				<li><p>The crane(point of loading) must be able to reach a height of 600mm and have a range of 600mm - error of 10% allowable.</p></li>
				<li><p>The main mast starting from base should be vertical.</p></li>
				<li><p>The base and vertical mast should be within an area of 200X200 mm at any cross-section.</p></li>
				<li><p>The lever arm should have an area less than 200X200 mm at any cross-section.</p></li>
				<li><p>The base must have extension of 3-4 cm at the base on both sides along the lever-arm direction, to hold the structure to the ground.</p></li>
				<li><p>The height of the mast can be anything but the angle of the lever arm with the horizontal must be below 22.5 degree -Clockwise/Anticlockwise.</p></li>
				<li><p>Hooks must be provided at the ends of the lever arm to support the load where the structure would be loaded and counter-loaded.</p></li>
				<li><p>For counter balancing load, loading pan and weight will be provided at the competition.Participants will be allowed to increase counter balance load on the loading<br>
				pan only three times after the commencement of loading.</p></li>
				<li><p>Hook on the counter balancing side must be atleast 20 cm apart from the main structure.</p></li>
				<li><p>The structure should be a truss and not a beam.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Over-lap Criteria</b>-Not more than two sticks must have a complete side-side overlap.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Joint Criteria</b><p>-Overlap of two members at a joint must not be greater than 20mm on either side.</p></li>
				<li><p>No lateral supports in the form of struts should be present.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Critical point exemption</b>-Base and hook regions are exempted from over-lap criteria i.e, any number of sticks can be overlapped over each other.<br>
				For the hook region only a length of 5 cm along the lever arm is exempted.Base region is exempted only up to a height of 4cm from the bottom.</p></li>
				<li><p>Failing to abide by above terms will lead to intermediate disqualification.</p></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Materials</h3>
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                <li><p>The Tower crane must be constructed only form popsicle sticks(120mm X 12mm X 2mm) and adhesives.(Synthetic white adhesive or single component<br>
				cyano-acrylate adhesive).</p></li>
                <li><p>No other materials may be used.The tower crane should not be stained,painted or coated in any fashion with any foreign substance.</p></li>
                <li><p>The popsicle sticks may be cut or trimmed to any shape or size.</p></li>
                <li><p>The adhesive can only be used to join popsicle sticks together; however adhesives cannot be applied on the free surface of the member sticks to increase its strength.</p></li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Grading Criteria</h3>
				<p>The scoring will depend on:</p>
				<ol>
				<li><p><b>Self-weight</b>:Mean and standard deviation of all the entries will be found and M-factor will be calculated by using the following formula:<br>
				M=(self-weight - mean of self-weight of all entries)/Std. of maximum load of all entries.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Loading</b>:The maximum load of all the entries will be found and K-factor will be calculated by using the following formula:<br>
				K=(maximum load - mean of maximum load of all entries)/Std. of maximum load of all entries.</p></li>
				<li><p>The final score will be  given by 8*k factor - 2*M factor.</p></li>
