				<h3>ABOUT THE EVENT</h3>
				<p>It is a robotic competition focussing on overcoming various hurdles spread over a rugged terrain. It should be a very robust bot whose strength, swiftness and endurance will be put to test.</p>

				<h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
				<p>To design a wireless or wired bot which can reach its destination by tackling all the obstacles coming in its way as quickly as possible.</p>

				<h3>BOT SPECIFICATION</h3>
				<p>1. Bot dimension should be such that it can be enclose inside a box of dimensions 30cm*30cm*30cm.<br> 2. The bot can be controlled wirelessly or wired.<br> 3.Potential difference should not be more than 24 volts.<br> 4.The bot must be stable and there
					should be no separate part splitting up out of it.<br> 5.Manual bot must have on-board power supply.<br> 6.Manual bot should receive signal from a single remote control.
				</p>

				<h3>COMPETITION RULES</h3>
				<p>1. Events will be conducted in two phases i.e. Prelims and Finals.<br> 2. As the time starts the manual bot has to start from START line and travel through a path consisting of various hurdles and reach the FINISH line as soon as possible.<br> 3.
					Points will be deducted on skipping any hurdles.<br> 4. Points will be deducted on touching the bot.<br> 5. Due preference will be given to the bot which reaches its destination in less amount of time.<br> 6. At most 3 hurdles/obstacles can be skipped.<br>					7. Points will be deducted if BOT deviates from arena.<br> 8. Any team that is not ready at the specified time will be disqualified from the competition automatically.<br> 9. Team members are not allowed to enter or touch any part of the arena. In
					any situation , only organizers can make changes in the arena. If any member of the team is found manipulating the arena , the team will be disqualified immediately.<br> (More Rules based on the design of the track will be coming soon)
				</p>

				<h3>TEAM RULES</h3>
				<p>There can be at most four participants per team.<br> Students from different colleges can be a part of a single team.<br> An individual cannot be a part of more than one team.<br> All participants must be in possession of their Institute Identity
					Card during the event.</p>

				<h3>NOTE</h3>
				<p>The time measured by the organizers will be final and used for scoring.<br> In case of any dispute or ambiguity , event co-ordinator's Â decision will be considered final and binding.<br> The organizers reserve the rights to change any or all of the
